<h1>Social Layout - Project Overview and Instructions</h1>

<p>
  This interactive project, titled <strong>Social Layout</strong>, is designed to help visualize social dynamics within a given environment by representing individuals as customizable shapes and relationships as connecting lines. This project serves as a tool for analyzing the social layout in real-time, offering insights into how individuals are positioned and interconnected within a space. With features for adding people, creating connections, and editing their visual representation, this project is ideal for anyone needing a clearer picture of social structures, whether in a classroom, workplace, or social gathering.
</p>

<h2>Purpose of the Project</h2>
<p>
  The primary purpose of this project is to allow users to simulate social environments interactively. By representing people as shapes (circles and squares) and relationships as lines, users can gain a visual understanding of interactions, group formations, and personal connections within a space. This is useful for various applications, such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Event Planning:</strong> Organizers can plan seating arrangements and interactions.</li>
  <li><strong>Educational Settings:</strong> Teachers can monitor group work dynamics.</li>
  <li><strong>Office Layout:</strong> Managers can analyze team clusters and collaboration flow.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Each feature of the project provides an interactive way to manipulate the social layout. Below is a detailed description of each function:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Add People:</strong>
    <p>
      Use the "Woman (Circle)" and "Man (Square)" buttons to add people to the map. Each person is represented by a shape that can be customized in size, color, and energy (visual glow effect). To add a person, simply select one of the buttons and click within the main rectangle area where you want the person to appear.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Create Connections:</strong>
    <p>
      The "Connection" button allows you to create a link between two people, symbolizing a social or professional relationship. To connect two people, follow these steps:
      <ul>
        <li>Click "Connection" to activate connection mode.</li>
        <li>Click on the first person, then click on the second person to establish a connection line between them.</li>
        <li>The line will appear between the two shapes, representing a relationship.</li>
      </ul>
      This feature is useful for visualizing social networks, group formations, or collaborative pairs.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Edit Mode:</strong>
    <p>
      Click the "Edit" button to activate edit mode, which allows you to personalize each shape with a unique background image. This could be a photo of the individual or a symbol representing their role. When edit mode is active, each shape will display an edit icon (a small image icon in the top-right corner). Clicking this icon opens a file picker, allowing you to upload an image from your computer to set as the background for that shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you finish editing, click the "Stop" button to exit edit mode, hiding the edit icons on each shape. This feature is useful for adding more personal detail to the social layout, making it easier to identify individuals or roles visually.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Help Button:</strong>
    <p>
      The question mark button in the top-right corner of the screen opens this information page in a new tab, offering detailed explanations on each function and the purpose of the project. This is useful for first-time users or anyone needing a refresher on the available features.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions for Use</h2>
<p>
  1. Begin by adding people using the "Woman" and "Man" buttons. Customize the size, color, and glow for each person as needed.<br>
  2. To represent relationships or connections, use the "Connection" button and click two shapes to create a line between them.<br>
  3. For more personalization, activate "Edit" mode to add background images to each shape.<br>
  4. Use the help button (?) whenever you need guidance on project functions and usage.
</p>

<p>
  This project is designed for flexibility and ease of use, allowing you to dynamically represent social interactions and layout configurations within any environment. We hope this tool provides a valuable visualization aid for understanding and organizing social spaces!
