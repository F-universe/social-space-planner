Hello everyone!

Too often, we find ourselves dealing with individuals who, taken alone, seem to channel their energy through a single, straightforward path — like a stream running directly from one person to another without mixing or deviating. However, that’s not always the case. Many times, streams mix and merge, creating a current composed of multiple smaller flows, leaving us to wonder where this current is truly headed.

We all know that an object, a thought, or an entity without a clear direction or purpose can be a source of confusion and distraction on an existential level. This is why I created this simple illustrative tool. Using basic geometric shapes, it provides a clearer view of individuals or elements that otherwise lack clarity.

Purpose of the Project
The Social Layout project offers a flexible way to visualize social dynamics within a given environment. By representing people as shapes and connections as lines, you can create a clearer understanding of interactions and layouts within a space.

Key Features
Add People: Represent individuals with customizable shapes (circles and squares).
Create Connections: Link people to show relationships or interactions.
Edit Mode: Personalize shapes by adding background images, making it easier to identify specific individuals.
Help Button: Get detailed instructions on how to use each feature of the tool.
How to Use
Add people using the "Woman (Circle)" and "Man (Square)" buttons.
Use the "Connection" button to establish connections between individuals.
Toggle "Edit" mode to personalize each shape with unique background images.
Click the help button (?) for detailed information on each feature.
Contributing
Expand this simple framework by adding details, new features, and functions. In certain situations, having a clear visual layout of social structures can be incredibly valuable. Let's work together to make this tool even more useful in the search for clarity and direction.
